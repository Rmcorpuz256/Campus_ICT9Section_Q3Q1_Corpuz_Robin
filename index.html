        <td><br/><br/>A schoolgirl's mysterious paper finds its way into the hands of Caleb Koestler, the son of professor John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), fifty years after it was buried in a time capsule. John deciphers the encoded message, which correctly enumerates every significant calamity of the last 50 years and foretells three more tragedies, one of which will be a worldwide cataclysm. John seeks the assistance of the prophetic author's daughter and granddaughter in an attempt to prevent the ultimate catastrophe when his warnings are ignored.<br/><br/></td>

        <td><br/><br/>In my opinion i would say that this movie has a very great story board and that it uses the climax moments in the move very perfectly to simulate adrenaline in us people. It has a great job making the somewhat aliens kind of scary but in the end they where actually good aliens that where trying to save humanity from the upcomming events that would later destroy the earth.<br/><br/></td>

        <td><br/><br/>This movie in my opinion was one of my favourites because im usually into these types of movies. It has very high graphical videos and when you have good speakers you feel like your actually in the movie with the gunshots and explosions sounding so realistic. In my opinion you should deffinitly watch this movie if your into war/violent kinds of movies<br/><br/></td>

        <td><br/><br/>Normally i wouldnt really watch love movies such as movies like this, but this movie was something different.
